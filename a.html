  <h2> Abstract </h2>
    <p style="margin-top:15px;"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease" target="_blank" title="AD defenition">Alzheimer’s disease (AD)</a> is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Pathological proteins of AD mainly contain amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau. Their deposition will lead to neuron damage by a series of pathways, and then induce memory and cognitive impairment. Thus, it is pivotal to understand the clearance pathways of Aβ and tau in order to delay or even halt AD.</p> <center><img src="abstractfigure.png" width="70%"></center> <center>Figure1. Bloodcirculatory clearance and periphery clearance of Aβ and tau in AD</center>
    <p style="margin-top:15px;">Aβ clearance mechanisms include ubiquitin–proteasome system, autophagy-lysosome, proteases, microglial phagocytosis, and transport from the brain to the blood via the blood-brain barrier (BBB), arachnoid villi and blood-CSF barrier, which can be named blood circulatory clearance. Recently, lymphatic clearance has been demonstrated to play a key role in transport of Aβ into cervical lymph nodes. The discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels is another direct evidence for lymphatic clearance in the brain. Furthermore, periphery clearance also contributes to Aβ clearance. Tau clearance is almost the same as Aβ clearance. In this review, we will mainly introduce the clearance mechanisms of Aβ and tau proteins, and summarize corresponding targeted drug therapies for AD.
