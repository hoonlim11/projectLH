  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p style="margin-top:15px;">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be classified into two types according to genetic levels: early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) that accounts for a substantial part. AD is a progressive and multifactorial neurodegenerative disease accompanied by learning and memory deficits, which not only brings physical and mental damages to patients but also augments the burden of family and society (Alzheimer’s 2015; Reitz and Mayeux 2014). Pathological characteristics of AD primarily include three parts: extracellular senile plaques due to the deposition of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles resulting from tau phosphorylation as well as neuronal death. In addition, it is known that Aβ and tau can act as biomarkers in preclinical AD (Tan et al. 2014a). By monitoring their levels and inhibiting their production or increasing their clearance, it is likely to make early diagnosis  to promote the prevention and the treatment of AD. In addition, recent studies strongly showed that its Aβ clearance rather than its production that is impaired in LOAD (Mawuenyega et al. 2010). Hence, it is necessary to get hold of the role of protein clearance mechanisms in AD and understand the contribution of these mechanisms to the removal of Aβ and tau.</p><br>

  <p=style="margin-top:10px;">It must be admitted that some proteins can be eliminated by degradation, transport from brain into periphery, and periphery clearance. Studies showed that Aβ and tau can be degraded by the <a href="http://www.bostonbiochem.com/about/ubiquitin-proteasome-pathway-upp" target="_blank" title="Ubiquitin mechanisms">ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy" target="_blank" title="autophagy">autophagy-lysosome system (ALS)</a>, proteases (Chesser et al. 2013; Miners et al. 2011; Vilchez et al. 2014), and microglial phagocytosis (Li et al. 2014). In addition, Aβ can be exported out of the brain into the blood stream through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), arachnoid villi, and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), or into cervical lymph nodes by lymphatic clearance, including perivascular drainage, glymphatic pathway of interstitial fluid (ISF) along vascular basement membrane, or lymphatic drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, tau cannot be transported across the BBB, and other transport pathways are the same as Aβ clearance pathway (Tarasoff-Conway et al. 2015). There was evidence to show that Aβ and tau can be eliminated in periphery, which is beneficial to their reduction in brain (Dugger et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2015). </p>
  <p=style="margin-top:15px;">In this review, we will briefly describe the protein clearance systems and strongly focus on their roles in AD pathology, such as Aβ and tau. Moreover, we will summarize some related targeted treatments of AD.</p>
