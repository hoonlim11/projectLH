<h2>br의 쓰임새: 그냥 단순 줄바꿈. 닫힘태그가 없다</h2>
<strong>Alzheimer’s disease (AD)</strong> is the most common neurodegenerative disease.<br> Pathological proteins of AD mainly contain <u>amyloid-beta (Aβ)</u> and <u>tau</u>. Their deposition will lead to neuron damage by a series of pathways, and then induce memory and cognitive impairment. Thus, it is pivotal to understand the clearance pathways of Aβ and tau in order to delay or even halt AD.<br><br> Aβ clearance mechanisms include ubiquitin–proteasome system, autophagy-lysosome, proteases, microglial phagocytosis, and transport from the brain to the blood via the blood-brain barrier (BBB), arachnoid villi and blood-CSF barrier, which can be named blood circulatory clearance. Recently, lymphatic clearance has been demonstrated to play a key role in transport of Aβ into cervical lymph nodes. The discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels is another direct evidence for lymphatic clearance in the brain. Furthermore, periphery clearance also contributes to Aβ clearance. Tau clearance is almost the same as Aβ clearance. In this review, we will mainly introduce the clearance mechanisms of Aβ and tau proteins, and summarize corresponding targeted drug therapies for AD.

<p style="margin-top:25px;"> Intracellular proteins are mainly degraded via UPS and autophagy-lysosome. Extracellular proteins can be degraded by glial phagocytosis and proteases secreted by neurons and astrocytes. Extracellular proteins in ISF can be transported into blood via the BBB or into lymph by perivascular drainage and glymphatic drainage.</p> <p style="margin-top:15px;">Extracellular proteins in CSF can be removed to blood via the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) or to lymph by lymphatic drainage via perineural space and meningeal lymphatic vessels. And then by CSF absorption, proteins in CSF can be transported into blood via arachnoid villi and the blood–CSF barrier (BCSFB), and also into cervical lymph nodes via meningeal lymphatic vessels as well as perineural and perivascular space. Proteins in blood can be cleared by the blood complement system and also through periphery tissues.</p>
