  <h2> The Protein Clearance machinery </h2>
  <p style="margin-top:15px;">Under normal conditions, Aβ production in brain parenchyma results from hydrolyzing amyloid precursor proteins via betasecreted enzymes and gamma-secreted enzymes, and the most common subtypes of Aβ in human body are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta" target="_blank" title="wikipedia">Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42.</a></p>

  <center><strong>Amyloidogenic Processing</strong></center><br>
  Aß is formed after successive cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by -site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) and the -secretase complex. APP can be cleaved by the proteolytic enzymes α-, β- and γ-secretase; Aβ protein is generated by successive action of the β and γ secretases. The -secretase cleavage occurs in the middle of the membrane and liberates amyloid -protein (A) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD) . The γ secretase, which produces the C-terminal end of the Aβ peptide, cleaves within the transmembrane region of APP and can generate a number of isoforms of 36-43 amino acid residues in length.
  <p style="margin-top:15px;">Intracellular Aβ clearance can be achieved through UPS and ALS, and extracellular Aβ is degraded by glial phagocytosis, such as microglia, astrocytes, and proteases from neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 2). In addition, extracellular Aβ in ISF and CSF can be transported into the periphery. ISFAβ can be moved to the blood through the BBB (<a href="index.html">Fig. 2</a>) or to cervical lymph nodes via perivascular drainage and glymphatic pathway (<a href="b.html">Fig. 3a</a>). CSF Aβ can be removed to the blood via the BCSFB (Fig. 2) and the arachnoid villi or to cervical lymph nodes by lymphatic clearance (<a href="b.html">Fig. 3b</a>). Aβ in periphery is mainly cleared by blood components, such as red cells (RBCs) and monocytes, or some tissues and organs, such as the liver and kidney (<a href="index.html">Fig. 2</a>).</p>
